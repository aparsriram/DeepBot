Circle \\nb. Square \\nc. Straight line \\nd. Cannot be predicted  \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nDistance from centroid to boundary is same for every value of ϴ. This is true for Circle \\nwith a radius k. \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 2: \\nTo measure the Smoothness, coarseness and regularity of a region we use which of the \\ntransformation to extract feature? \\na. Gabor Transformation \\nb. Wavelet Transformation \\nc. Both Gabor, and Wavelet Transformation.  \\nd. None of the Above.  \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\nCorrect Answer: c \\n \\nDetailed Solution: \\nOne of the important approach to region description is texture content. This helps to provide \\nthe measure of some of the important properties of an image like smoothness, coarseness \\nand regularity of the region. We use Gabor filter and Wavelet transformation to extract \\ntexture feature.  \\nQUESTION 3: \\nSuppose Fourier descriptor of a shape has K coefficient, and we remove last few coefficient and \\nuse only first m (m<K) number of coefficient to reconstruct the shape. What will be effect of \\nusing truncated Fourier descriptor on the reconstructed shape? \\na. We will get a smoothed boundary version of the shape.  \\nb. We will get only the fine details of the boundary of the shape.  \\nc. Full shape will be reconstructed without any loss of information.  \\nd. Low frequency component of the boundary will be removed from contour of the \\nshape.  \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nLow frequency component of Fourier descriptor captures the general shape properties of \\nthe object and high frequency component captures the finer detail. So, if we remove the last \\nfew component, then the finer details will be lost, and as a result the reconstructed shape \\nwill be smoothed version of original shape. The boundary of the reconstructed shape will \\nbe a low frequency approximation of the original shape boundary.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nQUESTION 4: \\nWhile computing polygonal descriptor of an arbitrary shape using splitting technique, which of \\nthe following we take as the starting guess?  \\na. Vertex joining the two closet point above a threshold on the boundary.  \\nb. Vertex joining the two farthest point on the boundary.  \\nc. Vertex joining any two arbitrary point on the boundary.  \\nd. None of the above. \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\n \\nCorrect Answer: b \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nOptions are self-explanatory.  \\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 5: \\nConsider two class Bayes’ Minimum Risk Classifier. Probability of classes W1 and W2 are, P (ω1) \\n=0.3 and P (ω2) =0.7 respectively. P(x) = 0.545, P (x| ω1) = 0.65, P (x| ω2) =0.5 and the loss \\nmatrix values are            [𝜆11\\n𝜆12\\n𝜆21\\n𝜆22]                    \\nIf the classifier assign x to class W1, then which one of the following is true. \\na. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 < 1.79 \\nb. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 > 1.79 \\nc. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 < 1.09 \\nd. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 > 1.09 \\n \\nCorrect Answer: b \\nDetailed Solution: \\n𝜆21 −𝜆11\\n𝜆12 −𝜆22\\n> 𝑃(𝜔2 𝑥\\n⁄ )\\n𝑃(𝜔1 𝑥\\n⁄ ) \\nNow,  P(ω1/x) = P (ω1)* P (x| ω1) / P(x) = 0.3*0.65 / 0.545 = 0.358 \\nP(ω2/x) = P (ω2)* P (x| ω2) / P(x) = 0.7*0.50 / 0.545 = 0.642 \\n𝜆21 −𝜆11\\n𝜆12 −𝜆22\\n> 1.79 \\n____________________________________________________________________________ \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\nQUESTION 6: \\nThe Fourier transformation of a complex sequence of number 𝑠(𝑘) for 𝑘= 0, … , 𝑁−1 is given \\nby: \\na. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0\\n \\nb. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁\\n𝑘=0\\n \\nc. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0\\n \\nd. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁2\\n⁄\\n𝑘=−𝑁2\\n⁄\\n \\nCorrect Answer: c \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nOptions are self-explanatory.  \\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 7: \\nThe gray co-occurrence matrix C of an unknown image is given in below.  What is the value of \\nmaximum probability descriptor?  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig 1: C \\na. 3/17 \\nb. 1/12 \\nc. 3/16 \\nd. 5/16 \\n1 \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\n1 \\n2 \\n2 \\n3 \\n2 \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution: \\nMaximum probability = max (cij). cij is normalized co-occurrence matrix. Total values in C \\nis 17.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nQUESTION 8: \\nWhich of the following is not a boundary descriptor. \\na. Polygonal Representation \\nb. Fourier descriptor \\nc. Signature \\nd. Histogram.  \\nCorrect Answer: d \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nHistogram is a region descriptor. \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 9: \\n \\nWe use gray co-occurrence matrix to extract which type of information?  \\na. Boundary \\n \\nb. Texture \\n \\nc. MFCC \\n \\nd. Zero Crossing rate.  \\nCorrect Answer: b \\nDetailed Explanation: We use different feature from the gray co-occurrence matrix to \\ndetermine the textural content of an image region.  \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nQUESTION 10: \\nIf the larger values of gray co-occurrence matrix are concentrated around the main diagonal, \\nthen which one of the following will be true?  \\ne. The value of element difference moment will be low. \\nf. The value of inverse element difference moment will be low. \\ng. The value of entropy will be very low. \\nh. None of the above. \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution: \\nOptions are self-explanatory. We can’t comment anything on the entropy based on the \\nvalues of diagonal elements. Because it depends on the randomness of the value.  Whereas \\nelement difference moment will be low and inverse element difference moment will be high.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\n************END*********** \\n'}"

Circle \\nb. Square \\nc. Straight line \\nd. Cannot be predicted  \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nDistance from centroid to boundary is same for every value of ϴ. This is true for Circle \\nwith a radius k. \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 2: \\nTo measure the Smoothness, coarseness and regularity of a region we use which of the \\ntransformation to extract feature? \\na. Gabor Transformation \\nb. Wavelet Transformation \\nc. Both Gabor, and Wavelet Transformation.  \\nd. None of the Above.  \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\nCorrect Answer: c \\n \\nDetailed Solution: \\nOne of the important approach to region description is texture content. This helps to provide \\nthe measure of some of the important properties of an image like smoothness, coarseness \\nand regularity of the region. We use Gabor filter and Wavelet transformation to extract \\ntexture feature.  \\nQUESTION 3: \\nSuppose Fourier descriptor of a shape has K coefficient, and we remove last few coefficient and \\nuse only first m (m<K) number of coefficient to reconstruct the shape. What will be effect of \\nusing truncated Fourier descriptor on the reconstructed shape? \\na. We will get a smoothed boundary version of the shape.  \\nb. We will get only the fine details of the boundary of the shape.  \\nc. Full shape will be reconstructed without any loss of information.  \\nd. Low frequency component of the boundary will be removed from contour of the \\nshape.  \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nLow frequency component of Fourier descriptor captures the general shape properties of \\nthe object and high frequency component captures the finer detail. So, if we remove the last \\nfew component, then the finer details will be lost, and as a result the reconstructed shape \\nwill be smoothed version of original shape. The boundary of the reconstructed shape will \\nbe a low frequency approximation of the original shape boundary.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nQUESTION 4: \\nWhile computing polygonal descriptor of an arbitrary shape using splitting technique, which of \\nthe following we take as the starting guess?  \\na. Vertex joining the two closet point above a threshold on the boundary.  \\nb. Vertex joining the two farthest point on the boundary.  \\nc. Vertex joining any two arbitrary point on the boundary.  \\nd. None of the above. \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\n \\nCorrect Answer: b \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nOptions are self-explanatory.  \\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 5: \\nConsider two class Bayes’ Minimum Risk Classifier. Probability of classes W1 and W2 are, P (ω1) \\n=0.3 and P (ω2) =0.7 respectively. P(x) = 0.545, P (x| ω1) = 0.65, P (x| ω2) =0.5 and the loss \\nmatrix values are            [𝜆11\\n𝜆12\\n𝜆21\\n𝜆22]                    \\nIf the classifier assign x to class W1, then which one of the following is true. \\na. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 < 1.79 \\nb. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 > 1.79 \\nc. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 < 1.09 \\nd. \\n𝜆21−𝜆11\\n𝜆12−𝜆22 > 1.09 \\n \\nCorrect Answer: b \\nDetailed Solution: \\n𝜆21 −𝜆11\\n𝜆12 −𝜆22\\n> 𝑃(𝜔2 𝑥\\n⁄ )\\n𝑃(𝜔1 𝑥\\n⁄ ) \\nNow,  P(ω1/x) = P (ω1)* P (x| ω1) / P(x) = 0.3*0.65 / 0.545 = 0.358 \\nP(ω2/x) = P (ω2)* P (x| ω2) / P(x) = 0.7*0.50 / 0.545 = 0.642 \\n𝜆21 −𝜆11\\n𝜆12 −𝜆22\\n> 1.79 \\n____________________________________________________________________________ \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\nQUESTION 6: \\nThe Fourier transformation of a complex sequence of number 𝑠(𝑘) for 𝑘= 0, … , 𝑁−1 is given \\nby: \\na. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0\\n \\nb. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁\\n𝑘=0\\n \\nc. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0\\n \\nd. 𝑎(𝑢) = ∑\\n𝑠(𝑘)𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑢𝑘/𝑁\\n𝑁2\\n⁄\\n𝑘=−𝑁2\\n⁄\\n \\nCorrect Answer: c \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nOptions are self-explanatory.  \\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 7: \\nThe gray co-occurrence matrix C of an unknown image is given in below.  What is the value of \\nmaximum probability descriptor?  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig 1: C \\na. 3/17 \\nb. 1/12 \\nc. 3/16 \\nd. 5/16 \\n1 \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\n1 \\n2 \\n2 \\n3 \\n2 \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution: \\nMaximum probability = max (cij). cij is normalized co-occurrence matrix. Total values in C \\nis 17.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nQUESTION 8: \\nWhich of the following is not a boundary descriptor. \\na. Polygonal Representation \\nb. Fourier descriptor \\nc. Signature \\nd. Histogram.  \\nCorrect Answer: d \\nDetailed Solution:  \\nHistogram is a region descriptor. \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\nQUESTION 9: \\n \\nWe use gray co-occurrence matrix to extract which type of information?  \\na. Boundary \\n \\nb. Texture \\n \\nc. MFCC \\n \\nd. Zero Crossing rate.  \\nCorrect Answer: b \\nDetailed Explanation: We use different feature from the gray co-occurrence matrix to \\ndetermine the textural content of an image region.  \\n  \\n \\nNPTEL Online Certification Courses \\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nQUESTION 10: \\nIf the larger values of gray co-occurrence matrix are concentrated around the main diagonal, \\nthen which one of the following will be true?  \\ne. The value of element difference moment will be low. \\nf. The value of inverse element difference moment will be low. \\ng. The value of entropy will be very low. \\nh. None of the above. \\nCorrect Answer: a \\nDetailed Solution: \\nOptions are self-explanatory. We can’t comment anything on the entropy based on the \\nvalues of diagonal elements. Because it depends on the randomness of the value.  Whereas \\nelement difference moment will be low and inverse element difference moment will be high.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\n************END*********** \\n'}"
